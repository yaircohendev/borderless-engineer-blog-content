In today **#front\_end** video we are going to talk about IndexedDB!

Basically, IndexedDB is a full-blown DB in the browser, it has amazing capabilities but also has tradeoffs.

In today video we will talk about:

- What is indexedDB
- What are the benefits of IndexedDB
- IndexedDB vs LocalStorage
- IndexedDB use-cases
- IndexedDB limitation
- How to avoid blocking the UI with IndexedDB

I also know that the last few videos didn't contain any visuals, so I spent a ton of time editing this video.
