One of the most popular and misunderstood principals is the DRY principle.

Many people think that DRY is about duplication of code, but in fact it's about duplication of knowledge.

In this [#software\_design](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/software_design?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZVDLMCl-0ZwUreeFGErnTrnkLNSLVQPrOFoaaBKbalTc7i2l_uYVk5vUvwP4Nk8yUtBwG94TLV3_8Q10NIw_X8Y7G4yJblgHNr7d-SrAhgHLV5LN6Sgxn5R2iYcSa3e2Jw&__tn__=*NK-R) video I dove deep into the DRY principle, talked about what it actually means, and the design principle behind it (coupling).

I also explained what is coupling, when you should couple/decouple your code and how all of that relates to DRY.
